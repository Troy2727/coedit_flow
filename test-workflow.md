# Testing GitHub Workflow

This file is created to test the GitHub workflow after removing the path filters.

## Changes Made

- Removed `paths-ignore` filters from the workflow configuration
- This should allow the workflow to run when any file is changed, including markdown files

## Expected Behavior

The workflow should now run and include:
- Linting and TypeScript checking
- Building the application
- CodeQL security analysis
- Production deployment (if secrets are configured)
